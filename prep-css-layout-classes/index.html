        <h3>Iron Man 1</h3>
        <p>A billionaire industrialist and genius inventor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is conducting weapons tests overseas,
      but terrorists kidnap him to force him to build a devastating weapon. Instead, he builds an armored suit and upends his
      captors. Returning to America, Stark refines the suit and uses it to combat crime and terrorism.</p>

        <h3>Iron Man 2</h3>
        <p>With the world now aware that he is Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from
      all sides to share his technology with the military. He is reluctant to divulge the secrets of his armored suit, fearing
      the information will fall into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and "Rhodey" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) by
      his side, Tony must forge new alliances and confront a powerful new enemy.</p>

        <h3>Iron Man 3</h3>
        <p>Plagued with worry and insomnia since saving New York from destruction, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), now, is more
      dependent on the suits that give him his Iron Man persona -- so much so that every aspect of his life is affected,
      including his relationship with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). After a malevolent enemy known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley)
      reduces his personal world to rubble, Tony must rely solely on instinct and ingenuity to avenge his losses and protect
      the people he loves.</p>
